Week12 hw: incoporated msql with Node

I took 2 screen shots. First one, shows how the options are presented as everything after everything is connected. Screen shot 2, is showing how when adding a new product it creates a new row in the Table. This assignment was challenging because of the intial connection. I had a lot of errors but was able to get it functional. This homework took me a long time to complete.
